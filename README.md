# Gamers Launcher

NOTE: this is my hobby project and i dont use it for commercial use. This project is just for satisfying my ego.

This launcher supports both Windows and Linux. In Windows, it's using `C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/GamersLauncher`,
in Linux, it's `~/.local/share/GamersLauncher` as app data location.

In AppData location, it stores:

```
logs/ -> generated by `lib/liblogger.so`
minecraft/ -> the minecraft path that launcher uses (different than a regular mc path)
  instances/ -> contains profiles like in a sandbox
    1.21.11/ -> instance name
      saves/
      resourcepacks/
      options.txt
      ... -> bunch of other mc stuff
      instance.cfg -> instance config that holds arguments etc.
  assets/ -> minecraft shared assets (objects, indexes etc.)
  libraries/ -> minecraft shared libs
  java/ -> JVM that is used to run minecraft
  versions/ -> mc version jars
settings.json -> app's settings file
```
